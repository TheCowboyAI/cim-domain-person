# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01  
**Context**: Need flexible, composable person data management

**Decision**: Adopt ECS pattern using Bevy framework
- Person aggregate contains only core identity (ID, name, lifecycle)
- All other data managed as components
- Systems process component changes reactively

**Rationale**:
- Allows runtime composition of person attributes
- Avoids rigid class hierarchies
- Enables efficient querying and filtering
- Aligns with game development patterns for managing entities

**Consequences**:
- (+) Highly flexible data model
- (+) Performance benefits from ECS query system
- (+) Easy to add new attributes without changing core
- (-) Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with ECS
- (-) More complex than traditional OOP models

## ADR-002: Minimal Aggregate Design

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01  
**Context**: Determining what belongs in Person aggregate vs components

**Decision**: Keep Person aggregate minimal
- Only ID, name, and lifecycle state in aggregate
- Everything else (contact, skills, preferences) as components

**Rationale**:
- Reduces coupling between core and extensions
- Simplifies aggregate root responsibilities
- Allows optional data without nullable fields
- Supports domain evolution without breaking changes

**Consequences**:
- (+) Clean separation of concerns
- (+) Easy to extend without modifying core
- (+) Reduced memory footprint for basic persons
- (-) Requires component queries for full person data
- (-) More complex than monolithic aggregate

## ADR-003: Event Sourcing for State Management

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01  
**Context**: Need audit trail and temporal queries

**Decision**: Use event sourcing for all state changes
- All mutations through commands
- State derived from event stream
- Snapshots for performance optimization

**Rationale**:
- Complete audit trail requirement
- Support for temporal queries
- Natural fit with CQRS pattern
- Enables event-driven integrations

**Consequences**:
- (+) Full history preservation
- (+) Easy to implement new projections
- (+) Natural integration with other domains
- (-) Increased storage requirements
- (-) Complexity in handling schema evolution

## ADR-004: Cross-Domain Integration Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-02  
**Context**: Person domain needs to integrate with multiple other domains

**Decision**: Event-driven integration with explicit boundaries
- Subscribe to external domain events
- Transform to internal commands
- Publish person events for other domains
- No direct database access across domains

**Rationale**:
- Maintains domain autonomy
- Enables independent deployment
- Clear contracts between domains
- Supports eventual consistency

**Consequences**:
- (+) Loose coupling between domains
- (+) Independent evolution of domains
- (+) Resilient to domain failures
- (-) Eventual consistency complexity
- (-) Need for correlation tracking

## ADR-005: Projection-Based Read Models

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-02  
**Context**: Different use cases need different person views

**Decision**: Create specialized projections
- NetworkView for relationship graphs
- SearchView for full-text search
- SkillsView for competency analysis
- SummaryView for overviews
- TimelineView for activity history

**Rationale**:
- Optimized for specific query patterns
- Can evolve independently
- Supports different storage backends
- Enables caching strategies

**Consequences**:
- (+) Optimal performance for queries
- (+) Flexibility in data representation
- (+) Can use appropriate storage per projection
- (-) Synchronization complexity
- (-) Storage duplication

## ADR-006: Component Registration Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-03  
**Context**: Need to manage growing number of component types

**Decision**: Explicit component registration
- All components must implement Component trait
- Registration in application setup
- Runtime type checking for safety

**Rationale**:
- Type safety at boundaries
- Clear inventory of components
- Enables reflection capabilities
- Supports dynamic component discovery

**Consequences**:
- (+) Type-safe component handling
- (+) Clear component registry
- (+) Runtime introspection
- (-) Boilerplate for registration
- (-) Potential runtime errors if not registered

## ADR-007: Test Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-03  
**Context**: Need comprehensive testing approach for ECS architecture

**Decision**: Multi-level testing strategy
- Unit tests for components and aggregates
- Integration tests for cross-domain flows
- System tests for ECS behaviors
- Property-based tests for invariants

**Rationale**:
- ECS requires different testing patterns
- Cross-domain flows need integration tests
- Property tests catch edge cases
- System tests verify ECS queries

**Consequences**:
- (+) Comprehensive test coverage
- (+) Catches ECS-specific issues
- (+) Validates cross-domain contracts
- (-) Complex test setup
- (-) Slower test execution

## ADR-008: Performance Optimization Strategy

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2024-04  
**Context**: Need to handle large numbers of persons efficiently

**Decision**: Implement performance optimizations
- Component indexing for fast queries
- Event snapshots at intervals
- Projection caching with TTL
- Batch processing for bulk operations

**Rationale**:
- ECS can handle scale with proper optimization
- Snapshots reduce event replay time
- Caching reduces repeated computations
- Batching improves throughput

**Consequences**:
- (+) Better performance at scale
- (+) Reduced query latency
- (+) Lower resource usage
- (-) Increased complexity
- (-) Cache invalidation challenges
