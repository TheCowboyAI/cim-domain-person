# Documentation and Code Cleanup Complete

## Summary

The cim-domain-person module documentation and code has been cleaned up with the following changes:

### Documentation Cleanup

1. **Removed transition comments** from all source files
   - Removed TODO, FIXME, NOTE comments that were related to the transition
   - Cleaned up placeholder comments
   - Removed deprecated notes

2. **Updated documentation files**
   - Updated README.md to remove transition language
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md to remove deprecated section
   - Fixed PHASE3_SUMMARY.md to remove accidentally added code block
   - Removed references to "migration" and "transition" throughout

### Code Cleanup

1. **Fixed import paths**
   - Changed all `crate::components::ComponentType` to `crate::aggregate::ComponentType`
   - Fixed ComponentData imports to use `crate::components::data::ComponentData`
   - Fixed ComponentStore and InMemoryComponentStore imports

2. **Fixed compilation errors**
   - Added missing `regex = "1.10"` dependency (already present)
   - Removed duplicate EmploymentType enum definition
   - Fixed DateTime<Utc> to NaiveDate conversions where needed
   - Fixed field name from 'reason' to 'merge_reason' in PersonMergedInto

3. **Removed unused imports**
   - Used `cargo fix` to automatically remove 30+ unused imports
   - Cleaned up unused variables with underscore prefixes
   - Removed deprecated command and event stubs

### Current Status

The library now compiles successfully with minimal warnings:
- Main library compiles without errors
- Some test files still have compilation errors (not part of cleanup scope)
- All transition-related comments have been removed
- Documentation is now focused on the current implementation

### Files Modified

- All files in `src/` directory had unused imports removed
- `src/commands/mod.rs` - removed deprecated command stubs
- `src/events/mod.rs` - removed deprecated event stubs
- `src/cross_domain/person_organization.rs` - removed duplicate EmploymentType
- `src/components/data/*.rs` - fixed ComponentType imports
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `PHASE3_SUMMARY.md` - updated documentation

The codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable without the transition artifacts.
