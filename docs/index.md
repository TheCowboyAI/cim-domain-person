## Quick Start

```rust
use cim_domain_person::{
    aggregate::{Person, PersonId},
    value_objects::PersonName,
};

// Create a person
let person_id = PersonId::new();
let name = PersonName::new("Alice", "Johnson");
let person = Person::new(person_id, name);

// Register components
person.register_component(ComponentType::EmailAddress)?;
```

## Key Concepts

### ECS Architecture
The Person domain follows an Entity Component System pattern where:
- **Person aggregate** contains only core identity
- **Components** provide all other attributes
- **Cross-domain relationships** connect to other domains

### Network Analysis
Powerful capabilities for analyzing relationships:
- Professional networks and hierarchies
- Influence scoring and community detection
- Geographic distribution analysis
- Collaboration opportunity identification

### Privacy and Compliance
Built-in support for:
- GDPR compliance (right to be forgotten)
- Component-level access control
- Audit trails for all operations
- Configurable retention policies

## Domain Relationships

```mermaid

    Loc[Location Domain]
    Pol[Policy Domain]
    
    Person -->|Employment| Org
    Person -->|Addresses| Loc
    Person -->|Permissions| Pol
    
    Person -->|Networks| Person
```

## Getting Help

- Review the [Implementation Guide](implementation_guide.md) for common patterns
- Check the [API Reference](api_reference.md) for detailed type information
- See the [Testing Guide](testing_guide.md) for test examples
- Consult [User Stories](user_stories.md) for business scenarios

## Contributing

When contributing to the Person domain:
1. Follow the ECS architecture principles
