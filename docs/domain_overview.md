# Person Domain Overview

## Executive Summary

The Person domain in CIM represents the core identity and relationships of individuals within the system. Following an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, it focuses on minimal core identity while enabling rich composition through components and cross-domain relationships.

## Domain Vision

The Person domain serves as the central hub for:
- **Identity Management**: Core legal identity and lifecycle tracking
- **Network Analysis**: Understanding relationships between people, organizations, and locations
- **Component Composition**: Flexible attribution through ECS components
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Seamless interaction with Organization, Location, and Policy domains

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Minimal Core Aggregate
The Person aggregate contains only:
- **PersonId**: Unique identifier (Entity in ECS)
- **CoreIdentity**: Legal name, birth/death dates
- **Lifecycle**: Active, Deactivated, Deceased, or Merged states
- **Component Registry**: Tracks attached components

### 2. Component-Based Extension
All other attributes are managed as components:
- Contact information (Email, Phone)
- Skills and certifications
- Preferences and behaviors
- Social profiles and networks

### 3. Cross-Domain Relationships
Relationships are first-class concepts:
- **Person-Location**: Addresses, work locations, travel patterns
- **Person-Organization**: Employment, partnerships, affiliations
- **Person-Policy**: Permissions, restrictions, compliance

## Key Capabilities

### Identity Management
- Create and maintain person records
- Handle name changes and lifecycle events
- Merge duplicate identities
- Track deceased individuals

### Relationship Mapping
- Map professional networks
- Track organizational hierarchies
- Identify influence patterns
- Analyze communication networks

### Component Flexibility
- Add/remove capabilities dynamically
- Track component history
- Query by component presence
- Compose complex profiles

### Privacy and Compliance
- Component-level access control
- Audit trail for all changes
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Configurable retention policies

## Integration Points
