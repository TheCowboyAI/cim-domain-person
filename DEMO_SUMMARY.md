let customer = service.create_customer(
    PersonId::new(),
    "John Doe",
    Some("john@example.com"),
    Some("+1-555-0123"),
);
```

### Adding Behavioral Data
```rust
let behavioral = BehavioralComponent {
    purchase_behavior: PurchaseBehavior {
        average_order_value: Some(150.0),
        purchase_frequency: Some(6.0),
        // ... more fields
    },
    // ... more patterns
};
customer.add_component(behavioral, "analytics", Some("Monthly update".to_string()))?;
```

### Building Views
```rust
let customer_view = CustomerView::from_person(&customer);
println!("Engagement Score: {:?}%", customer_view.engagement_score);
```
